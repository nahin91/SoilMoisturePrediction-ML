# SoilMoisturePrediction-ML

**Machine Learning Project for the Master Degree Prgram in Franfurt University of Applied Sciences**

The purpose of this project is to predict soil moisture and finding an efficient Machine Learning Model that fits well with the subjected dataset. The predictions are made on 4 different fields by sampling data from the dataset.

In this Project, I have made soil moisture predictions on four different crop fields for irrigation schedules using three machine learning models: Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression. After going through the data processing pipeline, the ML models are trained with the transformed data to generate predictions. Then the predictions were tested, followed by the metric evaluation- MAE, MSE, RMSE, R2. Finally, based on the evaluation scores, Random Forest Regression Model is found to be the most efficient model to work with the subjected dataset. Since there are few variations between the predictions and actual data, it might be infered that the data are broadly distributed and fit the tree model well. This initiative also assists the farmers in making their schedules for irrigation in the crop fields.

**This is my first ever machine learning project. Any suggestion or advice from the expart might help me to advance my learning and working process.**
